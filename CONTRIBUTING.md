# Contributing to this course

Contributions are welcome, but will be reviewed for fit with existing materials. For this reason, please make sure that you discuss any potential changes with us first to make sure you work can be integrated. Please use issues or email to start the discussion.

## Your contributions

Please make sure that you have the rights to make the contribution. By sending a pull request, you agree to license any contribution you offer under the project license.

## Working with OpenOffice / LibreOffice

As you probably noticed, the slides are provided as ODP (OpenOffice / LibreOffice) files. For the time being, we intend to maintain this file format.

Differencing and merging this type of file (which cannot be handled using GitHub's text-based algorithms) is hard.

Please follow this basic advice when changing files and sending a pull request:

- List the slide numbers where you made changes
- Only make the minimal amount of changes necessary
- In your commit message list the affected slides and explain the change
- Break up any larger contribution into small and semantically closed steps
- If your contribution is one step of several, please name the underlying issue/feature/discussion
- In any case, keep all changes small and semantically closed

Please note that in order to avoid too much formatting confusion, we are likely to copy over slides from your slide deck to our slide deck. This may confuse git / GitHub but ensures visual integrity of the slides.

## Giving credit

We will happily list any contributions on the last page of each slide deck that has been contributed to.
